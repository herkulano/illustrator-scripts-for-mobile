## Collection of Illustrator Scripts for Mobile

This is a collection of Adobe Illustrator Scripts that exports layers or artboards to PNGs of different densities (iOS Retina Display, Android Devices, etc).

## How to install

If you place the script in the Adobe Illustrator CS5/Presets/Scripts folder, the script will appear in the File > Scripts submenu.

If you place the script in another location on the hard disk, you can run the script in Illustrator by choosing File > Scripts > Browse.

## How to use

1. Choose the folder where you want to save the files.
2. That's it, all files will be saved on the appropriate directories.

Note on exporting layers:  
Locked layers visibility will be ignored and also they will not be exported.
For example, this can be used to keep global layers visibility or guide layers from being exported.

## Tip

If you use Effects change the Effect > Document Raster Effects Settings > Resolution to at least Medium (150ppi), so effects have enough resolution to scale.

Due to the lack of optimization of the PNGs exported by Illustrator I recommend the use of a PNG optimizer.
